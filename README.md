# Unlimited Medium Freedium

A Safari extension that automatically redirects Medium articles to Freedium, allowing you to read Medium articles without a subscription.

## Features

- Automatically detects Medium article URLs
- Instantly redirects to the Freedium version of the article
- Works with all Medium domains (medium.com and *.medium.com)
- No configuration needed - just install and it works!

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Select the "macOS (App)" target
4. Build the project (âŒ˜B)
5. Open Safari
6. Go to Safari > Settings > Extensions
7. Enable "Unlimited Medium Freedium"
8. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

## How it Works

When you visit a Medium article (e.g., `https://medium.com/@author/article`), the extension automatically redirects you to the Freedium version of the article (e.g., `https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@author/article`).

## Example

Original URL:
```
https://medium.com/@batrakov.vitaly/async-let-vs-task-group-5cd391d68f71
```

Redirects to:
```
https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@batrakov.vitaly/async-let-vs-task-group-5cd391d68f71
```
